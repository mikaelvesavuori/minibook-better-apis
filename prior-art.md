# Prior art

You might be interested in a previous piece of work I've done: [multicloud-serverless-canary](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/multicloud-serverless-canary), especially if you want to see more on the Azure and GCP side of CI and canaries.

There's also [microservices-testing-workshop](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/microservices-testing-workshop) for a similar "workshop + demo" approach, but focusing on testing an event-driven serverless application.
