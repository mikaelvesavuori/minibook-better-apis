# Prior art

You might be interested in [microservices-testing-workshop](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/microservices-testing-workshop) for a similar "workshop + demo" approach but focusing on testing an event-driven serverless application.

There's also a previous piece of work you can look at: [multicloud-serverless-canary](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/multicloud-serverless-canary), which might pique your interest if you want to see more on the Azure and GCP side of CI and canaries.
