# Workshop assignment

_Given the scenario, how would you approach addressing the requirements?_

The workshop addresses typical skills needed of a technical lead or solution architect, prioritizing making considered architectural choices and being able to clearly communicate them.

This is possible to do two ways, either _with_ or _without_ code, as is needed based on the audience.

**⏳ Suggested timeframe (no code)**: 1 hour.

or

**⏳ Suggested timeframe (with code)**: 2 hours. You can start from [`src/FakeUserBasic/index.ts`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/src/FakeUserBasic/index.ts).

The output should be a diagram or other visual artifact, and if also coding, a set of code that demonstrates a full or partial solution.

At the end of the period, present your solution proposal (~5-10 minutes).
