# Context

You will be especially interested in this project if you have ever been involved in situations like the ones below, and want to have ideas for how to address them:

- You inherited something that is "impossible to work with or understand"
- Your team was unable to deliver new features because changes would mean breaking them for someone else
- You built something but don't know who your consumers are
- You document in Confluence or Sharepoint or something like that. If your document at all. You don't, since there is no allotted time for it. OK so maybe the API sometimes, but it's never up to date, really. To be honest, you tell people "ask me if you have questions, don't trust the docs".
- You looked up what [DORA metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) are and laughed out the words "yeah not my company no sirree never"
- You say that you are "autonomous" but someone always keeps freezing deployments to the shared staging environment so the only actual autonomous thing is `localhost`
- You say that you "implemented" continuous delivery, but it's still too painful to integrate and release without a gatekeeper and crashing a hundred systems
- You have heard "we cannot have any confidence in our systems if we don't do real, manual scheduled all-hands-on-deck testing with frozen versions of all external systems" so many times you actually have started to believe that ludicrous statement
- You wonder if things would be better with more infra and more environments, but start having nightmares when you do some back-of-the-napkin math on how many you'd need, not to mention the burden of supporting them logically

There are a million more of those, but you get the point; It's a dark and strange place to be in.

While it's fun to throw around the old Piranesi drawing or [Happiness in Slavery](https://imvdb.com/video/nine-inch-nails/happiness-in-slavery) video as self-deprecating memes, I think it is Escher who brilliantly captures the "positive" side of this messâ€”That things become very, very strange when multiple realities and gravities are seen _together, at once_. Even if one "reality" is perfectly stable and sound, the work of architects is to support all the realities that need to work together.

So: We need to get back some of that control so the totality does not look more like chaos than whatever it is that we are attempting to do.

At the end of the day, our work is about supporting the shared goals (business, organization, or personal goals, if it's a pet project) and letting us stay safe, sound, and happy working professionals while doing so.
