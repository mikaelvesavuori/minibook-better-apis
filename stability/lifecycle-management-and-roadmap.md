# ðŸ—º Lifecycle management and roadmap

We can follow the convention where we divide an API's lifecycle into design, lifetime, sunset, and deprecation phases (see resources below). Beyond these, we add the notion of being "removed" which is the point at which a feature has been completely purged from the source code.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: We'd keep a roadmap like the below in our docs. Imagine that today is 25 November 2021 and see below what our code base represents:

| Feature                                   | Group/Flag            | Beta start      | Stable          | Sunset         | Deprecated       | Removed         |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Use hardcoded response                    | N/A                   | 1 August 2021   | 8 August 2021   | 1 October 2021 | 15 November 2021 | 15 January 2022 |
| Use RandomUser instead of JSONPlaceholder | Group `devNewFeature` | 1 November 2021 | 15 January 2022 | N/A            | N/A              | N/A             |
