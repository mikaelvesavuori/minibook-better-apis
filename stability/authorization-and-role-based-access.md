# ðŸŽ­ Authorization and role-based access

You'll often see tutorials and such talking about [authentication](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authentication/), which is about how we can verify that a person really is that person.

[Authorization](https://www.osohq.com/academy), on the other hand, is knowing what this person is allowed to do.

_Authentication is entirely out of scope here, whereas trivial authorization IS in scope._

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 1**: In `serverless.yml` (lines 60-62) we define an authorizer function, located at [`src/FeatureToggles/controllers/AuthController.ts`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/src/FeatureToggles/controllers/AuthController.ts). Then on lines 70-74, we attach it to the `FakeUser` function. Now, the authorizer will run before the FakeUser function when called.

In our self-contained, basic demo we use a handcrafted [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (role-based access control) to attach a user group to each of the users. The user group is added as a flag in the subsequent call to the actual service.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 2**: In [`src/FeatureToggles/config/userPermissions.ts`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/src/FeatureToggles/config/userPermissions.ts) users are matched like so:

{% code title="src/FeatureToggles/config/userPermissions.ts" %}

```typescript
export const userPermissions: Record<string, UserGroup> = {
  "erroruser@company.com": "error",
  "legacyuser@company.com": "legacy",
  "betauser@company.com": "beta",
  "standarduser@company.com": "standard",
  "devuser@company.com": "dev",
  "devnewfeatureuser@company.com": "devNewFeature",
  "qauser@company.com": "qa",
};
```

{% endcode %}

For more full-fledged implementations, consider tools like [Oso](https://www.osohq.com) to authorize on the overall "access level". [See for example this demo](https://www.osohq.com/post/add-authorization-to-a-serverless-nodejs-app) using a similar serverless stack, or the plain [quick start version](https://docs.osohq.com/node/getting-started/quickstart.html).
