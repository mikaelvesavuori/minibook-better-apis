# ðŸ•µ AWS baseline observability

There's a lot written and discussed when it comes to _observability_ vs _monitoring_. Let's go with Google's definition taken from [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/devops):

> Monitoring is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to watch and understand the state of their systems. Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.
>
> Observability is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined in advance.

Further, let's also add that monitoring classically is said to consist of the three "pillars" [logs, metrics, and traces](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch04.html). In the cloud, theseÂ are all typically pretty easy to set up and we should aim to at least have these under control.

Of the three pillars, tracing is maybe the least well-understood. Do read [Lightstep's good introductory article on tracing\_](https://lightstep.com/distributed-tracing/) if you are interested in that area!

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: Our [`serverless.yml`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/serverless.yml) configuration enables [X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) in the `tracing` object. By default, [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) log groups are created. Next, we add the [`serverless-plugin-aws-alerts`](https://github.com/ACloudGuru/serverless-plugin-aws-alerts) plugin to give us some basic metrics (throttles, etc.). [Read more here](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-ops-metrics). Taken together, these give us a very good level of baseline observability right out of the box.

{% code title="serverless.yml" %}

```yml
provider:
  [...]
  tracing:
    apiGateway: true
    lambda: true

plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-aws-alerts

custom:
  alerts:
    dashboards: true
```

{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}

Refer to the [CloudWatch Logs Insights query syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html) if you want to set up some nice log queries. Also note that a shortcoming with CloudWatch is that they don't seem ideal for cross-service logs, but they are just fine when it comes to checking on a specific service. This is the intention behind the coming Honeycomb addition below.

{% endhint %}

You can now see dashboards (metrics) in both the Lambda function view and CloudWatch (plus the logs themselves) and get the full X-Ray tracing. It's just as easy as that! Done deal.
