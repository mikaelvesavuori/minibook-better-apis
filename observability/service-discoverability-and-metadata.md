# ðŸ—‚ Service discoverability and metadata

[Service discovery](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37148836/what-is-service-discovery-and-why-do-you-need-it) seems to be a very hot topic among the Kubernetes crowd. With serverless FaaS like we are using here (AWS Lambda), that's not really an interesting discussion. However, discoverability is not just a technical questionâ€”it's also something that absolutely relates to the social, organic, and management layers.

At some point that _single_ function will be one service, which will soon maybe become hundreds of services and then thousands of functions. **How to keep track of them?**

To some extent, it's possible to get a high-level picture inside of AWS or by being a CLI crusader. Unfortunately, if you are not, then there is no option unless you buy, build, or adapt some open-source solution.

{% hint style="info" %}

One such open-source solution is Spotify's [Backstage](https://backstage.io) which offers a broad set of ideasâ€”no wonder since it's labeled as "an open platform for building developer portals". It's a bit heavy, but some pretty big players are starting to use it.

For a super-lightweight AWS-based and flexible solution, you might want to consider [catalogist](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/catalogist) written by yours truly.

{% endhint %}

For a lighter-weight system, I'd argue that the reasonable data to pull in would be a subset of the metadata (and processes and output) we have generated and written previously. In a corporate context, we'd want to ensure that the source of truth of the state of our systems/applications resides with the codebaseâ€”Not in a closed tool like Sharepoint or Confluence or similar.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: See [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/manifest.json) for a napkin sketch of how one could work with service metadata if you had somewhere to send it and store it, during the CI stage. _This format is also very similar to the one used in [catalogist](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/catalogist)_.
