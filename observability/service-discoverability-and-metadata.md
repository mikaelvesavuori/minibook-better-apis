# ðŸ—‚ Service discoverability and metadata

[Service discovery](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37148836/what-is-service-discovery-and-why-do-you-need-it) seems to be a very hot topic among the Kubernetes crowd. With serverless FaaS like we are using here (AWS Lambda), that's not really an interesting discussion. However, discoverability is not just a technical questionâ€”it's also something that absolutely relates to the social, organic, and management layers.

At some point that one function will be one service, which will be hundreds of services and thousands of functions. How to keep track of them? To some extent, it's possible to get a high-level picture inside of AWS or by being a CLI crusader. Unfortunately, if you are not, then there is no option unless you buy, build, or adapt some open-source solution.

One such open-source solution is Spotify's [Backstage](https://backstage.io) which offers a broad set of ideasâ€”no wonder since it's labeled as "an open platform for building developer portals". It's a bit heavy, but some pretty big players are starting to use it.

For a lighter-weight system, I'd think the reasonable data to pull in would be some of the metadata and processes and output we have generated and written previously. In a corporate context, we'd want to ensure the source of truth of the state of our systems/applications resides with the codebase (not in, say, Sharepoint or Confluence or similar), but that a fresh representation is always available in some less developer-oriented context, say on an internally accessible website.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: See `manifest.json` for a napkin sketch of how one could work with service metadata. Of course, this is not a functional solution, as you'd need something to extract that data and store it somewhere meaningful.
