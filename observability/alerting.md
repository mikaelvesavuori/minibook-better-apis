# Alerting

Alerts (or alarms; same thing) are usually connected to metrics. When the metric is triggered, the alert goes off.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: We set up an alarm in `serverless.yml` on lines 75-83. This particular alarm gets attached to the `deploymentSettings` object and was (as seen previously) part of how we ensure that an alarm can cancel a canary deployment.

_Tip: You can extend this behavior to, for example, communicate the alert to an SNS topic which in turn can inform a pager system, Slack/Teams, or send an email to a relevant person. A better way of doing this would probably use a shared service that can also keep a stored log of all events, rather than just relaying the alert directly to a source._
