# Refactor continuously ("boy scout rule")

It takes perseverance, good communication, and business folks that truly understand software to get dedicated time for improving the solutions we work on. Most people will unfortunately not work in teams with dedicated refactoring time. What to do, then?

Rather than think of "change" as a drastic, singular, large-scale, and long-term event, it's better to see change as a stream of small, manageable events that we can shape. Robert Martin wrote about the notion that every change in a codebase should also include some form of improvement in his classic book, [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/). Read a [short summary here](https://matheus.ro/2017/12/11/clean-code-boy-scout-rule/) and a [longer article on continuous refactoring here](https://www.codit.eu/blog/continuous-refactoring/). The "boy scout rule" is definitely colored by other (at the time) contemporary management ideas like [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) that work well in agile/lean contexts.

**🎯 Example**: Hard to point to something "post-fact", but every single bit has been continuously enhanced and refactored (sometimes removed) since starting this project.

See [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) for several ways to approach practical code improvements. Also, see the list at the bottom of this page for more resources.
