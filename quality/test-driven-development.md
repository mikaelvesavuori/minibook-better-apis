# ðŸ¥¼ Test-Driven Development

[Test-driven development](https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/) is a practice that a lot of people swear by. I'm a 50/50 person myselfâ€”sometimes it makes sense to me, sometimes I just write the tests after I feel I'm out of the weeds when it comes to the first implementation. No need to be a fundamentalist; be a pragmatist! The important thing is that _there are tests_, not so much how and when they came.

However, in case you want to be a good-spirited TDD crusader then I've made it easy to do so.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: Just run `npm run test:unit:watch` and Jest will watch your tests and source code. You can also modify what Jest "watches" in the interactive dialog.
