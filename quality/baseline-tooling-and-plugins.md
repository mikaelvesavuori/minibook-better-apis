# ðŸ§° Baseline tooling and plugins

This project uses two very commonâ€”but hugely effectiveâ€”tools, namely [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io). These two ensure that you have a baseline, pluggable way of ensuring similar standards (and automation of them) across a team. Really, the first thing you want to make sure of is that the code looks and reads the same, regardless of who wrote it. Using these, now you can.

_Don't forget to enable "fix on save"! Also consider the VS Code plugins for [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)._

When it comes to more IDE-centric plugins in the security department, I highly recommend the [Snyk Vulnerability Scanner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner) (the successor to [vulncost](https://github.com/snyk/vulncost)) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Other nice ones include:

- [Abracadabra, refactor this!](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicoespeon.abracadabra)
- [Checkov](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bridgecrew.checkov)
- [DevSkim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CST-E.vscode-devskim)
- [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: You'll see that this project has configurations files such as `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` laying around. I'd not write many lines without those tools around.
