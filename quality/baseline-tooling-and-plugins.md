  The collective impact of several, on their own, small tools can make the
  difference between misery and joy very tangible.

# ðŸ§° Baseline tooling and plugins

This project uses two very commonâ€”but hugely effectiveâ€”tools, namely [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io). These two ensure that you have a baseline, pluggable way of ensuring similar standards (and automation of them) across a team. I'd not write many lines without those tools around.

Really, one of the very first things you want to make sure of is that the code looks and reads the same, regardless of who wrote it. Using these tools, now you can.

Don't forget to enable "fix on save"! Also consider the VS Code plugins for [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) if you are using VS Code.
{% endhint %}

When it comes to more IDE-centric plugins in the security department, I highly recommend the [Snyk Vulnerability Scanner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner) (the successor to [vulncost](https://github.com/snyk/vulncost)) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Other nice ones include:

* [Abracadabra, refactor this!](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicoespeon.abracadabra)
* [Checkov](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bridgecrew.checkov)
* [DevSkim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CST-E.vscode-devskim)
* [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: You'll see that this project has configurations files such as `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` laying around.
