# Open source license compliance

We must only use good, well-establish open source licenses.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: We verify that we only use a set of allowed open-source licenses, using [license-compliance](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-compliance), and can also use [license-compatibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-compatibility-checker) to check for compatibility between our license and used ones'. You can see the license set in `package.json` under the `licenses` script, as being `MIT;ISC;0BSD;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;Apache-2.0;Unlicense;CC0-1.0`.
