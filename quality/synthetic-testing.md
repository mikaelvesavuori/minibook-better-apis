# ðŸ¤– Synthetic testing

Synthetic testing sounds cool and intriguing and vaguely futuristic, but it's really no more than a directed stream of traffic from a non-human source, such as a computer.

Previously we used a smoke testâ€”which is certainly a type of synthetic testâ€”but there is another dimension I want to bring up as well: We can use synthetic testing to continuously verify that our solution _keeps_ performing as expected. In that regard, we can think of it as a kind of "offensive testing" mechanism we submit our live code to.

Running synthetic traffic is something that can certainly stress the existing instance/server/machine/environment, but in our case we could also leverage it _during the deployment window_ (when rolling out a canary deployment) to more fully exercise the system, flushing out any issues. This would also give us a higher probability of hitting any issuesâ€”which we may not do during a (for example) 10-minute window with low organic traffic.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example**: We can use load testing to run various larger-scale synthetic traffic volumes as one-offs to stress the API. Under [`tests/load/k6.js`](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/better-apis-workshop/blob/main/tests/load/k6.js) you can see our [k6](https://k6.io) script that we run in CI. The use-case we have here is to ensure that our system responds correctly when provided with a range of inputs rather than just doing the quick poke-and-feel we did with the smoke test.

Synthetics can be run with almost anything: Examples include a regular API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest), a load testing tool like [k6](https://k6.io) or [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io), a SaaS product like [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com), or a managed tool like [AWS CloudWatch Synthetics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries.html). Even `curl` works fine! If you want to set something up to continuously run against your endpoint, I recommend using an easy-to-use tool like CloudWatch Canaries or Checkly, directing them to your endpoint.
