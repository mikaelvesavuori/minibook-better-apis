# ðŸ“œ Generate documentation

Documentation... Love it or hate it, but professionally produced software absolutely requires documentation at least as good as the software itself.

Some of the different types of docs we might need to produce include:

- **Customer-facing documentation**: Guides, tutorials, how-to's...
- **API documentation**
- **Technical documentation**: Class diagrams, deployment diagrams, dependency graphs...
- **Code documentation**: Comments...
- **Project/product documentation**: Internal stuff like tickets, roadmaps, call sheets...

So being lax about _what_ types of docs we are talking about is maybe not too helpful. But we can slice the cake differently, and try to bucket the above into two major categories:

- **Requires manual labor**: Intellectual work needed, not deterministic
- **Better when generated**: Context is complicated, dynamic, but deterministic

{% hint style='tip' %}

Just like code, documentation is a liability and a responsibility. The more of it you have, the higher the price of upkeep can be.

{% endcode %}

While it would be unrealistic to say that you shouldn't need to write documentation, we can at least get to the point where as much as possible of the documentation can be generated and output through automation.

Here, we use the [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) standard for documenting source code.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 1**: Open up any TS file in the `src` folders.

Then, we use [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) for generating docs from the source code.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 2**: You can generate documentation into the `typedoc-docs` folder by running `npm run docs`. These are the documents uploaded to [the static website](https://better-apis-workshop.pages.dev) as well.

For diagrams, we use [Arkit](https://arkit.pro) for generating diagrams from your software architecture.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 3**: See the [Arkit diagrams](workshop/architecture-diagrams). As with the docs, these are also generated with `npm run docs`.

Taken together, this means that you can easily make rich documentation available in a central, visible location (like a static website in this case) in the CI stage. This is precisely what I've done on my end for this project: These diagrams also get uploaded to Cloudflare Pages on each commit to `main`.

**ðŸŽ¯ Example 4**: See `.github/workflows/main.yml` for the CI script.
